No Mongod Instance can become primary node in the undernoted case :-

1) Arbitary Node is down
2) Primary node goes down
3) And replica set even number of nodes up and running. this will result into even election case. And tie will occur as a result of election and no will become primary.

To Solve this more we have keep other attributes in mind for the elections to choose new proimary in any case :-

Conclusion
The most important thing is to have an uneven number of votes. Knowing this, it should be obvious that you either want 0 arbiters or 1...but never, ever more.

It's also important to understand that election doesn't rely on the majority of available servers, but of all servers in the set. A 3-server replica set will not tolerate 2 servers failing. Thinking in terms of network splits in the context of separate data centers helps me visualize this.
